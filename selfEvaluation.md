# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
I feel much more confident about this than previous modules. I took the time to break down the steps into notes that I could understand and that has made a world of difference.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
It was unproductive at first, but became more productive once i broke down the different parts of the task and named and identified them
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I could go over all of it agaain, honestly. Not having video tutorials has made this difficult and hard to reference.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
None at the moment.
